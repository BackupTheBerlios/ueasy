<center><b>uEasy: The to-do List</b></center>
<hr>

<p><i>The whole project's structure specified, almost everything is implemented. Contributions and enhancements are welcome</i>

<p>Immediate wishes
<ul>
<li>Write a plugin for Spip
<li>Write a plugin for CCMS
<li>Write a plugin for DocBook
<li>Traduction for the HTML and Wiki plugins, by now these plugins are only in french
<li>In case a mode is not found, log it into a special log file so that the admin can see which plugin the users need
<li>Look for PNG icons for the editor instead of the GIF ones
<li>Find and fix the bug that prevents the open dialog from showing
</ul>

<p>Mid-term wishes
<ul>
<li>Write a CMS interface for Spip
<li>Write a CMS interface for CCMS
<li>Enhance the test CMS ( the PHP files in /cms )
<li>Correct the editor's bugs
<li>Add images support in the editor
<li>use uFlow's errorMessage to carry exceptions stack traces
<li>Wait for the next release of Apache's XML-RPC and use the "liteclient" JAR Ryan Hoegg is planning to do. In the meantime, using xmlrpc-applet JAR would be better than the present JAR which includes far too much code
<li>Clean up the HTML loading part of the editor
<li>use Translatrix for the editor-relative dialogs, using a language passed with uFlow's OPEN reply (should be added to the uFlow specification soon), the distributiuon JAR will contain tiny resource files.
<li>create a Md5SocketServiceServer using java.security.MessageDigest
<li>Modify ServiceServer and UMainServer this way: the ServiceServer is started by command, batch or bash sript, it reads its properties file looking for Services it has to start, then dynamically loads them.
<li>Bug: removing a CSS style does not seem to work
<li>Enhance the LocalAmlFactory so that it loads a default language if the requested one is not available
</ul>

<p>Long-term wishes
<ul>
<li>Extend the HTMLEditorKit into an XHTMLEditorKit and use it in the editor
<li>Use a List of UClients and a List of UServers in UMainServer so that it can handle several UClients (for example an internet wysiwyg and a local standalone one) and several UServers (for example a production CMS and a live backup mirror)
<li>Enhance the SocketServiceClient with a web interface, list and state of services, actions on them, log reading
<li>Make the uFlow-aware modules 100% uFlow-aware, including the not-yet-implemented base64 icon transmission and some other points
</ul>
