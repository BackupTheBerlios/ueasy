How to install:
---------------

- uncompress the ueasy-xxxx.tar.gz into a directory.

------------
How to test:
------------

- go in the "server" directory
- run the "start" script
- go in the "stand" directory
- run the "run" script, a wysiwyg editor should appear
- go in your browser and browse applet/editor.html, the same editor should appear, embedded in an applet

With the editor, you can modify the default document, and save it. You can't use the wysiwyg open button by now.

Requirements:
- The CMS needs php4 (the standalone php4, not the Apache module)
- You obviously need a Java Virtual Machine to run the java server. The JRE from java.sun.com should work fine

Next step is to have a look at the configuration files in server/ and server/plugins/ and start hacking ;)

---------------
How to compile:
---------------

- go in the ueasy's directory
- run "ant"

You have to install ant if it is not, it is available as debian package and from jakarta.apache.org
